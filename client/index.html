					<h1>Recent updates!</h1>
					<h3>Global leaderboards</h3>
					<p>
						After being gone for a long time, the global leaderboards are now available again. <a
							href="/leaderboards"
						>Check them out</a>!
					</p>
					<h3>Server selection</h3>
					<p>
						As you may have noticed, Splix has changed a bit recently. Connecting to the teams gamemode has
						been broken for a while. So it's UI has been removed for now. Instead, you can now select a
						server that you'd like to connect to from the dropdown menu. Don't worry though! The plan is to
						bring back teams, hopefully within the next few weeks.
					</p>
					<h3>New server rewrite</h3>
					<p>
						The server code has been completely rewritten from scratch. There shouldn't be much of a
						difference though, the core gameplay is still the same, but there are some subtle differences.
						These servers may have some new bugs, but some long standing bugs have also been fixed. If you
						wish, you may select the 'Legacy' server from the dropdown menu to play on the old server.
					</p>
					<p>
						Overal, the new servers should be more stable than the old one, but more importantly: Their code
						is much more modern and better organised, which makes it easier to maintain them. Which brings
						me to my next point...
					</p>
					<h3>Splix is now open source</h3>
					<p>
						That's right, you can view or contribute to the code <a
							href="https://github.com/jespertheend/splix"
							target="_blank"
						>on GitHub</a>. This also allows you to host your own server instance. If you wish to play with
						just your friends, or if you want custom gameplay, the GitHub repository contains info on how to
						host and connect to your own instance.
					</p>
					<p>
						Feel free to contact @jespertheend on <a href="https://discord.gg/Zr3r5fJ" target="_blank"
						>the splix Discord</a> if you'd like your server to be added to the 'unofficial' section in the
						server selection dropdown menu.
					</p>
					<h3>Changelog</h3>
					<p>
						Changes for each version can be found <a
							href="https://github.com/jespertheend/splix/releases"
